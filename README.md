# Election-Analysis
## Module3 Challenge with Python

## Overview of Election audit:
  Main objective of the project is to help Tom for completing his election audit and discuss the information needed by the Colorado Board of Elections
  such as list of candidates, number of votes per county and the winning county and the winning candidate based on the total votes.

## Election-Audit Results:
  ### Results based on the the bulleted list
  - Total number of votes casted in the congressional election 
  
         `for row in reader:
            total_votes += 1`
  - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
    
         `Total Votes: 369,711`
   
         `County Votes:`
     
         `Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)`
     
         `Denver: 82.8% (306,055)`
     
         `Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)`
  
  - Which county had the largest number of votes?
   
         `Largest County Turnout: Denver`
  
  - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

        `Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)`

        `Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)`

        `Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)`
  
  - Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
  
        `Diana DeGette` is the winning candidate with `272,892` votes and  with a percentage of `73.8%`
 
## Election-Audit Summary:

      The script right now selected only few counties but the election commission can use this code to get the election results summary of all the counties in a state and also the code can be applied to summaraizing the results of multiple candidates across the nation and the election stats for different years
